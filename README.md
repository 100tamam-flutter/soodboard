# Soodboard - Flutter E-Commerce App Demo

## Overview

Soodboard is a collaborative effort by a dedicated team using the Scrum framework to develop a Flutter E-Commerce App. This project serves as a demonstration of various Flutter packages and best practices in mobile application development. Featuring a meticulously designed Figma UI, mock APIs for simulating real-world interactions, and following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, Soodboard is a testament to effective teamwork and modern development methodologies.

## Features
